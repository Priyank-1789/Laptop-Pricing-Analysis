# Laptop-Pricing-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing laptop prices using data science and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various specifications of laptops, such as RAM, CPU frequency, GPU, and storage, which are analyzed to predict laptop prices.

## 📊 Features & Analysis
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and price.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation to identify key factors affecting price.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Single Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression (Hyperparameter tuning using different alpha values)
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared Score (R²)

## 📁 Files in Repository
- `Laptops Pricing.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis.
- `data/` - (Optional) Folder containing dataset files.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-pricing-analysis.git
   cd laptop-pricing-analysis
   ```
2. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a requirements.txt file is needed, generate it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.)*
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📈 Results & Key Findings
- **Multiple Linear Regression performed better than Single Linear Regression**, achieving an **R² of 0.508** and a **lower MSE**.
- **RAM, CPU frequency, SSD storage, CPU cores, OS, GPU, and Category are the most significant predictors of price.**
- Ridge regression was used for further tuning and performance improvement.
